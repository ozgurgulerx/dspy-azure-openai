In recognition of the mutual exchange of information, the Parties commit to maintaining the secrecy of the Confidential Information received.

### Clause E

**Confidential Information Safeguarding Assurance**

The Receiving Party agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all information classified as "Confidential Information" and hereby undertakes not to divulge said information to third parties without explicit written approval from the Disclosing Party. This obligation includes implementing stringent access controls and limiting disclosure strictly to personnel whose roles necessitate such knowledge for the execution of duties under this Agreement. Clause Version 1:  
"**Termination of Agreement**  
This Agreement may be terminated forthwith by either Party upon the occurrence of any of the following circumstances: (a) a material breach of any covenant or obligation under this Agreement, which breach is not remedied within thirty (30) days following written notice; (b) insolvency, bankruptcy, or any similar proceedings initiated by or against the other Party, that are not dismissed within sixty (60) days; or (c) the mutual consent of both Parties, in written form, duly executed by authorized representatives."

Clause Version 2:  
"**Cessation of Contractual Obligations**  
Either party reserves the right to discontinue this Agreement immediately upon the commission of any significant default of its terms by the counterpart, provided that such default is not rectified within thirty (30) calendar days following the issuance of formal written notification. Furthermore, should either party become subject to proceedings under insolvency laws or engage in arrangements that indicate financial incapacity, the other party may elect to terminate this Agreement. Termination may also be effected by mutual concurrence documented in writing by both stakeholders."

Clause Version 3:  
"**Dissolution**  
The rights to end this Contract are reserved to either side, contingent on the fulfillment of specific conditions: 1. A fundamental infringement of the stipulations herein, uncorrected after a grace period of thirty (30) days post notification. 2. The instigation or recognition of liquidation or analogous fiscal procedures affecting the other Party, unresolved within two months. Additionally, a shared agreement obtained through written communication by both Parties holds the power to nullify this Contract."

Clause Version 4:  
"**Agreement Termination Provisions**  
This Contract shall be subject to termination at the discretion of either Party under the ensuing situations: the occurrence of a significant divergence from agreed terms, unresolved within a thirty (30)-day notice period given in writing; the onset of bankruptcy or insolvency conditions pertinent to a Party, if such conditions persist beyond sixty (60) days without resolution; or based on a collective decision reached by the Parties, expressed formally in writing."

Clause Version 5:  
"**Finalization and Nullification**  
This Agreement may be concluded, with immediate effect, upon the instigation of any substantial infringement, unsalvaged within the thirty (30) days subsequent to the dispatch of a written notice. Likewise, insolvency proceedings initiated against any Party, not abrogated within the sixty (60)-day timeframe, warrant termination. The Parties may also jointly dissolve this Agreement upon agreeing in writing." **Indemnity Clause Version 1:**

The Indemnifying Party agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Indemnified Party and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives from and against all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable legal fees, arising out of or in connection with any third-party claim or demand (the "Claims"). This obligation to indemnify shall apply whether such Claims arise out of tort, contract, or otherwise and regardless of any alleged negligence or other fault of the Indemnified Party, except to the extent directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnified Party. 

**Indemnity Clause Version 2:**

Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available under this Agreement, the Obligor shall indemnify and hold the Obligee blameless from any and all kinds of losses, damages, claims, or actions (collectively referred to as "Liabilities") that may arise or result from the Obligor’s acts, omissions, or breaches. Such indemnification shall cover all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees that might be incurred in defending any action, claim, or demand by an aggrieved third party.

**Indemnity Clause Version 3:**

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Party undertaking the indemnity (“Indemnitor”) shall indemnify, protect, and keep harmless the Party benefiting from the indemnity (“Indemnitee”), against any and all damages, settlements, and costs, including but not limited to legal defense costs (the “Expenses”) that may incur as a result of any action or claim brought by an external entity. This indemnity shall not extend to any wrongful acts directly attributable to sole negligence on the part of the Indemnitee.

**Indemnity Clause Version 4:**

The party hereinafter referred to as "Indemnitor" covenants to indemnify, save, and defend from harm the "Indemnitee", with respect to any form of loss, liability, or damage that may ensue from acts performed in connection with this Agreement. In this respect, indemnity extends to cover legal expenses reasonably incurred in relation to any such claims, save where such loss is a direct consequence of the Indemnitee's intentional and wrongful conduct.

**Indemnity Clause Version 5:**

In the spirit of mutual cooperation and legal fairness, the undersigned shall render indemnification to the other party for any detriments, liabilities, or demands imposed by third parties. This indemnification encompasses not only direct losses but also all associated legal expenditures reasonably sustained in the face of such challenges. Notwithstanding, this provision shall not excuse negligent or intentional harm instigated by the protected party. ### Force Majeure Clause

The party affected must promptly notify the other party of such delay and shall diligently strive to overcome the effects of such force majeure and resume compliance as swiftly as feasible.

5. **Clause E:**
   If either party is rendered unable to perform its covenants by reason of force majeure, including calamities such as earthquakes, hurricanes, explosions, accidents, embargoes, blockades, or any other cause beyond the reasonable anticipation and control of the parties, such failure to perform shall not be considered a breach. Prompt notification detailing the nature and expected duration of the delay shall be provided, and both parties are obligated to undertake all possible actions to address and mitigate the ramifications thereof, proceeding with performance once the hindrance ceases. 1. **Choice of Law**
