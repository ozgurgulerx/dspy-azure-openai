**Clause Option 1:**

In the event that either Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, to fulfill its contractual obligations due to events beyond its reasonable control, such as but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental regulations, labor strikes, or natural disasters, said Party shall promptly notify the other Party of the existence of such circumstances. Performance shall be suspended to the extent necessary during the period of such Force Majeure event. The affected Party agrees to use its best efforts to mitigate the impact of the delay or non-performance caused by the Force Majeure conditions.

**Clause Option 2:**

Neither Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performance under this Agreement that is due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, fire, flood, earthquake, government action, or other similar events (each a "Force Majeure Event"). In such cases, the Party affected by the Force Majeure Event shall notify the other Party as soon as practicable. Such notification shall suspend the obligations under this Agreement until the stopping of the Force Majeure Event.

**Clause Option 3:**

A Party shall not be held in breach of this Agreement for any interruption or failure to perform, in whole or in part, arising directly or indirectly from unforeseen and uncontrollable forces ("Acts of God") which may include earthquakes, hurricanes, civil commotion, or any other act prevailing beyond the Party's control. The affected Party is required to notify the other Party promptly, and both shall endeavor to return to normal performance as soon as feasible under the circumstances.

**Clause Option 4:**

In circumstances where a Force Majeure situation occurs, which might reasonably be considered at variance with the normal course of events, including but not limited to natural catastrophes, acts of war, infectious disease outbreaks, or regulatory actions, the Party unable to perform shall communicate in writing the occurrence of such Force Majeure as early as possible. Such declaration will relieve both Parties of their obligations under this Agreement whenever performance is hindered by these critical events. Efforts to minimize the event's impact shall be undertaken by all reasonable means.

**Clause Option 5:**

If a Party is wholly or partially hindered from adhering to its obligations due to extraordinary events which are unpredictable and unavoidable in nature, hence termed as Force Majeure—such as pandemics, armed conflict, legal sanctions, or exceptional meteorological conditions—such Party shall inform the counterpart promptly in writing. The obligations shall be suspended during the period of such adversity, and reasonable measures should be employed to overcome the obstacle posed by said Force Majeure conditions whenever practicable. 1. **Clause 1:**

---

### Clause 1: Compact Version
The parties hereto agree and covenant that all confidential information disclosed by either party to the other, either verbally or in written form, shall remain strictly confidential. Said information shall be used solely for the purpose intended and shall not be divulged to any third party without prior written consent, except as mandated by applicable law.

---

### Clause 2: Detailed and Elaborate
1. Confidentiality Obligation: In consideration of the mutual exchange of proprietary data, both parties, herein referred to as "Discloser" and "Recipient," unconditionally undertake and vow to safeguard all confidential, secretive, and non-public information shared by the Discloser in the course of this agreement.
   
2. Usage and Disclosure: The Recipient agrees, warrants, and binds itself to utilize the disclosed information only for the expressly stated purpose of this agreement and to refrain from divulging, transferring, or otherwise making available such information to third parties without the Discloser’s explicit written approval or unless such disclosure is necessitated by legal or regulatory directives.

3. Exclusions from Confidentiality: Information that is publicly known or becomes publicly known through no fault of the Recipient, or is independently developed without reliance on the confidential information, shall not fall under the auspices of this confidentiality obligation.

---

### Clause 3: Concise and Distinct
All sensitive, proprietary, and privileged materials exchanged between the undersigned parties are deemed confidential. Disclosure, replication, or dissemination of such material is prohibited unless expressly authorized in writing by the originating party or compelled by judicial or governmental orders.

---

### Clause 4: Informal yet Professional
So here’s the deal: Both parties, in the spirit of trust and cooperation, promise to keep a tight lid on all confidential information shared between them. Whether it’s business strategy notes or secret recipes, this data shouldn’t leave the room unless everyone gives the nod, or a lawyer says it’s a must due to laws we can't duck.
