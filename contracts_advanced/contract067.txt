**Option 1:**

In the event that unforeseeable circumstances, beyond the reasonable control of either Party, arise and hinder, delay, or render impracticable the performance of any obligation herein, including but not limited to cosmic phenomena, tempests, earthquakes, or other natural calamities, the affected Party, upon providing prompt notice to the other, shall be excused from executing the aforementioned duties for the duration of such disruptions. The resumption of obligations shall occur as soon as the impeding conditions abate, and the Party invoking this provision shall make all feasible efforts to mitigate the effects of such eventualities.

**Option 2:**

Should any unanticipated occurrences, such as acts of nature, cataclysmic events, or other extraordinary interventions beyond human control, impede a Party's fulfillment of its contractual responsibilities, said Party shall be released from such commitments as long as these conditions persist.

Upon cessation of the impacting circumstances, the obligations shall forthwith resume, and the Parties shall exert reasonable endeavors to diminish any adverse impact.

**Option 3:**

In the scenario where either Party finds its ability to perform its contractual duties thwarted by events of a catastrophic or extraordinary nature, including but not limited to, outbursts of natural forces, civil unrest, or unforeseen emergency situations outside the gamut of human influence, such Party shall be relieved from the obligations of this Agreement, provided swift communication has been made with the other Party.
