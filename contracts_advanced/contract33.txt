Either Party may terminate this Agreement, without incurring any liability, by providing thirty (30) days written notice to the other Party.

**Clause 2:**

This Agreement may be dissolved at any time by either Party giving sixty (60) days' prior written notification to the other Party. It is provided, however, that if there is a substantial failure by a Party to perform or observe any obligation under this Agreement, the other Party retains the right to unilaterally terminate the Agreement with a ten (10) day notice, contingent upon the defaulting Party's failure to cure said breach within said time frame.

**Clause 3:**

Upon mutual consent or unilateral decision by either Party, this Agreement is susceptible to termination, subject to a prior written alert delivered no less than forty-five (45) days in advance. In instances of grave non-compliance by either Party, the aggrieved Party reserves the right to terminate this contract forthwith, granting a twenty (20) day leeway for rectification, should the infringing actions be ameliorable.

**Clause 4:**

At the election of either Party, this Agreement can be nullified by serving a written notice thirty (30) days ahead of the intended cessation date. Furthermore, in scenarios where a significant infringement has transpired, the non-defaulting Party is empowered to terminate this contract instantaneously unless said breach is rectified within a stipulated cure period of ten (10) calendar days.

**Clause 5:**

This Contract shall remain in full force until terminated. Either party can conclude this Agreement, delivering no less than seventy-two (72) hours' advance written communication expressing intent to terminate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Contract shall be immediately terminable by the non-breaching Party if the other Party fails to address a major breach within five (5) business days following receipt of written notice specifying the breach and demanding its correction. 1. **Indemnification Obligation:**
