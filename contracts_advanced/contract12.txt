Clause 1:  
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, neither party shall be deemed in breach of this agreement or otherwise liable for any delay in performance or for non-performance attributable to any act, event, or circumstance beyond their reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, insurrection, pandemics, natural disasters, governmental regulations, strikes, lockouts, or other industrial actions. The affected party shall promptly notify the other party of the occurrence of such force majeure event and shall make diligent efforts to mitigate the impact thereof.

Clause 2:  
Neither Party shall hold the other accountable for any failure to fulfill obligations precipitated by extraordinary occurrences beyond reasonable anticipation or control—such as natural catastrophes, military conflicts, civic disturbances, acts of governmental authority, unforeseen epidemics, or any similar force beyond control. In such instances, the impacted Party must inform the other at the earliest convenience, endeavoring to minimize resultant adversities.

Clause 3:  
In the event any party is unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement due to causes that are beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods), acts of war, embargoes, labor strikes, or governmental decrees, such party shall be excused from performance for the duration of such force majeure event. This provision, however, shall not apply to obligations for the payment of money. The hindered party shall notify its counterpart as soon as practicable, detailing the expected timeline for resolution.

Clause 4:  
The Parties hereto agree that non-performance due to causes beyond the control of either Party, including, but not limited to, acts of nature, fire, epidemics, labor disruptions, acts of public enemies, or any official order from any governmental authority, shall not be considered a breach of this Agreement. Such delayed or non-performance shall be excused for the duration of the disruptive event, provided that the affected party utilizes all reasonable efforts to overcome the impacts of the force majeure event and resumes performance promptly upon the cessation of said event.

Clause 5:  
If any obligation under this agreement becomes impossible to perform, in whole or in part, due to an event beyond the reasonable foresight and control of either Party, such as acts of God, war, civil disorder, labor strikes, government policy changes, or national emergencies, neither Party shall be held liable for such delay or non-performance. It is understood that the Party affected by such unavoidable event shall be obliged to notify the other Party, detailing the nature and expected duration of the force majeure delay. **Data Protection Clause Version A**
