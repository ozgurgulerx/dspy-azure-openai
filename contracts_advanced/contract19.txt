**Clause 3: Preservation of Secrecy**

Under this Agreement, the Receiving Party covenants to shield any Secret Information from unauthorized access or use, ensuring that no dissemination whatsoever takes place to third parties unless mandated legally or permitted under a separate, written agreement.
