Certainly, here are variations of a Non-Disclosure Agreement clause:

---

**Confidentiality Obligation Clause**

The Receiving Party hereby covenants and agrees to maintain the utmost secrecy regarding any and all Confidential Information received, whether disclosed orally, in writing, or by any other means. Such Confidential Information shall not be exploited, used, or divulged to any third parties without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party shall employ reasonable steps to protect the Confidential Information, commensurate with the care used to safeguard its own highly sensitive information, but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care. Exceptions to this obligation may arise if disclosure is mandated by law or judicial order, provided that the Receiving Party promptly notifies the Disclosing Party and allows for intervention to contest or limit such disclosure.

**Non-Disclosure & Security Clause**

In accordance with the terms herein, the Receiving Entity is strictly prohibited from revealing or allowing unauthorized access to any Proprietary Data received from the Disclosing Entity. This duty encompasses protecting said data with equivalent diligence one would apply to their own proprietary information, ensuring no lesser or insufficient standard of care. The Receiving Entity shall refrain from using this information for purposes beyond the scope authorized by this Agreement, unless compulsory disclosure is triggered by legal obligations, whereupon the Receiving Entity shall notify the Disclosing Entity in a timely manner.

**Obligation of Confidentiality**

The Receiving Party pledges to uphold the confidentiality of all Proprietary Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party.

**Privacy & Secrecy Clause**

Under no circumstances, except as delineated herein, shall the Receiving Party share, employ, disseminate, or in any manner reveal Confidential and Proprietary Information imparted by the Disclosing Party. This clause obligates the Receiving Party to preserve such information with as much caution as it would its own, but in no case using less than a prudent level of care. Disclosure exceptions include compliance with applicable legal statutes, whereby advance notice shall be furnished to the Disclosing Party to afford an opportunity to seek a protective order or other similar remedy.

**Concealment Covenant**

The Receiving Party shall preserve the confidentiality of any non-public information shared by the Disclosing Party during the duration of this engagement.
