Termination shall take effect immediately upon fulfilment of any of these conditions.

2. **Clause 2: Comprehensive Termination Clause**
   In the event that either Party desires to terminate this Agreement, said Party shall provide the other with a written notice of intention to terminate at least sixty (60) days prior to the desired date of termination.

3. **Clause 3: Termination Under Extraordinary Circumstances**
   Either party may, at its sole discretion and without liability, terminate this Agreement by providing written notification to the other party under circumstances deemed extraordinary, including, but not limited to, acts of God, government restrictions, or any other condition beyond reasonable control that renders further performance impracticable.

**Clause 2:**

Should an unforeseen event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of either party, such as earthquake, flood, epidemic, war, riot, labor strike, or governmental intervention arise, rendering the performance of the agreed duties impracticable or impossible, said party shall be relieved from their obligations contained herein to the extent and duration of such impediment. [Optional: The party invoking this clause must provide written notice to the other party within ten (10) days of the occurrence of the force majeure event.]

**Clause 3:**

Neither party shall be deemed in breach of its obligations under this Agreement, nor shall it incur any liability to the other if it is unable to perform, or is delayed in performing, due to a fortuitous event, an act of nature, or other extraordinary occurrences such as pandemics, terrorist activities, legal restrictions, or significant industrial disputes unanticipated by the parties at the time this contract was executed.

**Clause 4:**

The parties agree that if performance of any part of this Agreement is impeded by factors beyond the anticipation and control of the parties, including, without limitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, acts of terrorism, regulatory actions, or other catastrophes, the affected party shall not be held accountable for non-performance until the cessation of such significant hindrance. The impacted party shall diligently notify the opposite party and endeavor to fulfill its contractual commitments as promptly as conditions permit.

**Clause 5:**

Should any eventuality such as acts of nature, governmental intervention, unexpected legal directives, widespread labor disturbances, or any global events occur that make the fulfillment of the Agreement obligations unfeasible, the affected party's duty to perform that obligation shall be suspended. The parties agree to communicate regularly during the pendency of such an event, aiming to circumvent prolonged disruption and resume normal obligations when practicable. Clause 1:
