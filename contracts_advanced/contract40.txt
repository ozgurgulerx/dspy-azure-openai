### Indemnity Clause Examples

#### Clause Example 1: Comprehensive and Detailed
The Indemnifying Party hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Indemnified Party from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of suit, arising out of or in connection with any breach of this Agreement, negligence, willful misconduct, or any violation of applicable law by the Indemnifying Party. This indemnity obligation shall extend to any acts or omissions by agents, subcontractors, or employees of the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of any claim for which it seeks indemnification, failing which the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable except where such failure does not prejudice the Indemnifying Party.

#### Clause Example 2: Concise and Direct
To the fullest extent permitted by the applicable statute, the Indemnifier agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnitee from any losses, liabilities, or costs (including attorney fees) that arise from third-party claims linked to the Indemnifier's breach or negligence. The Indemnifier’s duty to indemnify shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

#### Clause Example 3: Simplified Version
The Party responsible for any violation herein agrees to compensate and protect the other Party against all reasonable losses stemming from that violation. Said compensation includes any legal fees incurred while addressing the issue. Obligations under this indemnity remain effective even after the contract concludes.

#### Clause Example 4: Artistic Language
The Indemnifying Entity swears to shield, recompense, and uphold the integrity of the Indemnified Entity from any calamities, fiscal burdens, or legal snags that tumble forth from neglect, missteps, or any such beast of burden attributable to the Indemnifying Entity. A tale not told or a claim untold shall hinder not the right to indemnity unless rights are squandered or justice delayed.

#### Clause Example 5: Formal and Traditional
Herein, the Indemnifying Party pledges to indemnify and save harmless the Indemnified Party from and against all manners of obligations, suits, actions, losses, penalties, demands, and liabilities, howsoever arising – directly or indirectly – from the former’s failure to observe and perform its covenants. Such indemnification shall remain in full force notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement until all potential claims are resolved.

#### Clause Example 6: Casual Yet Clear
Look, if something goes sideways and it’s because of something Party A did or didn’t do, Party A’s gotta pay Party B back for any bills, losses, or lawyer fees that Party B racks up because of it. Party A promises to keep up their end even after we've both moved on from this deal. 

Each clause provides a unique approach to indemnity language, catering to varied legal needs and preferences. **Option 1: Comprehensive Force Majeure Clause**

In an unforeseen event, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, insurrection, embargoes, governmental restrictions, strikes, or any other substantial and unanticipated events beyond the reasonable control of the Parties (hereinafter "Force Majeure Events"), the obligations of the affected Party shall be postponed to the extent and for the duration that such performance is rendered impracticable. The affected Party shall notify the other Party immediately of such Force Majeure Event, taking reasonable steps to alleviate the effects thereof as promptly as possible. This clause shall not excuse either Party from the responsibility to make payments due or penalties incurred prior to the occurrence of the Force Majeure Event.

**Option 2: Brief Force Majeure Clause**

Neither Party shall be responsible for any failure to meet its obligations under this Agreement resulting from causes beyond its command, such as natural catastrophes, armed conflict, regulatory actions, or other unforeseeable phenomena. Prompt notification and reasonable efforts to mitigate are required by the impacted Party.

**Option 3: Detailed Force Majeure Clause with Remedies**

In the occurrence of an event preventing or delaying either Party’s due performance under this Agreement, which arises from significant disruptions including, but not limited to, extraordinary meteorological phenomena, widespread pandemics, geopolitical conflicts, or other events outside the anticipatory foresight of any prudent Party (collectively referred to as "Force Majeure"), the affected Party shall be granted a temporal extension on the performance of their obligations. The claiming Party must submit a written statement of the occurrence within five (5) business days, delineating the scope and expected duration of the inability to perform. Both Parties agree to negotiate in good faith adjustments to the timelines of affected obligations or to consider the possibility of alternative, fair, and equitable solutions to compensate for delays caused by such Force Majeure Events.

**Option 4: Simplified Force Majeure Clause with Optional Suspension**

Should either Party be unable to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement due to factors beyond its reasonable foresight and energy, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, governmental actions, or public disturbances, such obligations shall be suspended for the duration of the hindrance. Alternatively, either Party may elect to terminate the Agreement if the Force Majeure Event persists beyond a period of ninety (90) days, provided that the non-affected Party receives written notice. **Arbitration Clause 1:**

In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, the parties hereto agree to submit such dispute to binding arbitration.
