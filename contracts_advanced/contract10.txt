Clause 1: Confidentiality Obligations  
The Receiving Party agrees, without limitation, to maintain the highest degree of confidentiality with respect to the Information provided by the Disclosing Party, herein referred to as "Confidential Information." The Receiving Party shall not, at any time or for any reason, disclose, reveal, or make available such Confidential Information to any third party without prior, express, and written consent from the Disclosing Party, except where such information is required to be disclosed by law, regulatory authority, or court order. In such instances, the Receiving Party shall provide prompt notice to the Disclosing Party to enable them to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy.

Clause 2: Protection of Proprietary Data  
The recipient of the proprietary data (hereinafter "Recipient") covenants to employ all reasonable efforts to safeguard and protect all non-public, proprietary, or sensitive information (the "Proprietary Information") imparted by the provider (hereinafter "Provider"). This covenant includes refraining from the dissemination, replication, or unauthorized utilization of such information unless duly authorized in writing by the Provider. The Recipient must implement stringent measures as it would for its own proprietary information of similar importance, but no less than a reasonable standard of care, to prevent any unauthorized access or dissemination.

Clause 3: Preservation of Secrecy  
Each party undertakes and agrees that it will keep all confidential, proprietary, and private business or technical information (collectively, the “Confidential Contributions”) strictly secret and confidential. Such a duty shall be perpetual or until the written revocation or mutual consent is achieved. The obligation encompasses avoiding any direct or indirect disclosure or publication of the Confidential Contributions, except to employees or agents who have a specific need to know and who agree in writing to adhere to the equivalent confidentiality terms herein. Any breach of this obligation may result in irreversible harm, justifying equitable relief.

Clause 4: Duty of Non-Disclosure  
The Recipient is bound by a duty of non-disclosure regarding any material, verbal or written, marked or characterized by the Discloser as confidential. The Recipient shall exercise a prudent level of discretion when handling such confidential material, ensuring that it remains undisclosed to third-parties not explicitly authorized by the Discloser. Exceptions to this provision only apply if the said material enters the public domain through no fault of the Recipient, is rightfully received from another party without restriction, or is independently developed by the Recipient without reliance on the Propriety Information of the Discloser.

Clause 5: Secrecy and Usage  
The entity receiving the restricted and sensitive information (henceforth "Receiver") swears on its good faith to ensure total secrecy and limited usage of such information. The information shared by the discloser (hereafter "Discloser") shall remain in the confines of the relationship-provoked knowledge exchange and shall not be solicited for personal gain or any unauthorised purposes. This obligation persists indefinitely, save for when the information becomes publicly available through legitimate means other than Receiver’s action or inaction.

Clause 6: Classified Material Handling
The Acquiring Party undertakes to handle any classified information, hereinafter referred to as "Classified Material," provided by the Disclosing Entity, with the utmost care and in strict confidence. Except as mandated by applicable legal statutes or judicial directives, said Classified Material shall not be communicated, broadcast, or otherwise exposed to any unauthorized individual or entity. The Compromised Handling of such Material will trigger remedies akin to injunctions or other provisional measures as deemed fair and necessary to avert substantial harm. **Indemnity Clause 1**:  
The Indemnifying Party hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Indemnified Party from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, except to the extent such claims or liabilities result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnified Party.

**Indemnity Clause 2**:  
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the undersigned hereby undertakes to indemnify and safeguard the other party against any losses, demands, actions, judgments, settlements, and disbursements, including court costs and lawyers’ fees, that may arise directly or indirectly in relation to the execution, performance, or non-performance under or associated with this Agreement. The foregoing indemnification shall not be diminished, abated, or limited by any concurrent or contributory act or omission.

**Indemnity Clause 3**:  
The obligation of indemnity shall attach to the Indemnitor, who will compensate, defend, and protect the Indemnitee against all allegations, demands, or claims, without limitation to the nature and amount thereof, which may arise from the Indemnitor’s breach of any term or condition in this contract. Indemnity shall likewise include all legal fees, settlement costs, and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection therein.

**Indemnity Clause 4**:  
Akin to a shield, the Promisor shall indemnify and hold blameless the Promisee from any repercussions, setbacks, or litigation resulting from the Promisor’s action not in line with the stipulations of this Agreement. This includes, but is not limited to, all legal expenses, such as attorney fees and costs, arising in the ordinary course of conflict resolution. Provided, however, such indemnity does not extend to matters of misconstruction or acts manifestly wrongful by the Promisee.

**Indemnity Clause 5**:  
The Party assuming responsibility agrees to fully indemnify and hold the aggrieved party harmless from all forms of harm, grievances, penalties, or recoveries, comprising legal counsel charges and litigation costs, borne out of or tethered to any breach, oversight, or contravention by the indemnifying party, excluding instances where the harm arose out of the deliberate unlawfulness or substantial neglect of the indemnified party. **Clause Version 1:**

**Force Majeure Definition and Extension:**

Neither party shall be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement if such failure or delay is due to any cause beyond the reasonable control of the affected party (including, without limitation, acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, civil disorder, strikes, fire, flood, governmental action, or any other event of Force Majeure). In the event of any such delay, the time for performance shall be extended by a period equivalent to the period of such delay, provided that the affected party promptly notifies the other party of the commencement and cessation of such Force Majeure condition.

**Clause Version 2:**

**Acts Outside Reasonableness - Force Majeure:**

In the occurrence of any unforeseeable event arising beyond the ambit of a party's control, such as but not limited to, acts of nature, insurrections, industrial disputes, or government regulations (hereafter referred to as "Force Majeure Events"), the obligated party shall be exempt from performance under this Contract during the continuance of such events. The obligated party shall promptly communicate the onset and resolution of said event to the other party in writing. To the extent practicable, the affected party shall resume its performance with all reasonable dispatch once such inability is cleared.

**Clause Version 3:**

**Uncontrollable and Unforeseen Events - Clause of Force Majeure:**

Should any provision of this Agreement become hindered or impossible to perform due to an Act of God, war, riot, epidemic, governmental embargo, earthquake, utility outages, or any like exceptional circumstance (collectively, "Force Majeure Events"), and where such hindrance was neither anticipated nor controlled by either party hereto, the affected party shall not be considered at fault for non-performance. The obligations of the hampered party shall be suspended until such barriers to performance are removed. Notice of the incurrence and cessation of the Force Majeure Event is expected to be delivered promptly to the unaffected party.

**Clause Version 4:**

**Superior Force and Unforeseen Occurrences:**

In the instance that an entity finds its execution duties obstructed or encumbered by any influence beyond its foresight or governance ("Superior Forces"), including natural calamities, legislative edicts, widespread health emergencies, or civil unrest, such party shall not be deemed in default of its responsibilities herein documented. The engagement timetables shall be suitably realigned to reflect delays occasioned by these external elements, contingent on the condition that such party communicates the dynamic nature of the occurrence to the other, detailing ramifications as knowledge thereof arises.

**Clause Version 5:**

**Circumstances Beyond Control - Force Majeure:**

The parties shall not be held culpable for any non-performance or deferral stemming from unforeseen factors or conditions outstripping their influence or prediction capabilities, collectively referred to as “Force Majeure Conditions.” This encompasses, but is not confined to, acts of terrorism, natural catastrophes, hostilities, pandemics, or other disruptive phenomena. Contingent upon the exercisable evaluation, the impacted party shall take judicious steps to minimize the effects and pass notice to the opposing party forthwith. The timeline for fulfilling obligations will therefore be adjusted accordingly. 1. **Legal Jurisdiction**: The interpretation, construction, and performance of this Agreement, as well as any disputes arising herefrom, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [State Name], without regard to its conflict of law principles.
