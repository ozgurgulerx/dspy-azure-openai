**Version 1: Comprehensive Clause**

The Receiving Party hereby irrevocably covenants and undertakes to maintain the absolute confidentiality of all Confidential Information received from the Disclosing Party. This obligation shall be deemed to encompass—without limitation—all proprietary data, trade secrets, business plans, and other non-public information, whether disclosed orally, in writing, or by any other means. The Receiving Party agrees not to disclose, reproduce, or otherwise make available any Confidential Information to third parties without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, except as required by law. For the purposes of this provision, "Confidential Information" shall exclude information that is or becomes publicly known without breach of this Agreement, that is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, or that is received by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any obligation of confidentiality.

**Version 2: Concise Clause**

The Receiving Party must hold all shared Confidential Information in strict confidence and shall not disclose it to any third parties, except as necessitated by legal requirements. Confidential Information refers to any proprietary or non-public knowledge, whether communicated verbally or in written form.

**Version 3: Plain Language Clause**

You agree to keep our secrets just that—secrets. You promise not to tell anyone else our confidential information unless we say it is okay or the law says you have to. Information is not secret if it's already public, you come up with it yourself, or someone else gives it to you legally.

**Version 4: Formal Clause**

The Recipient Party is bound to preserve the utmost confidentiality concerning any information designated as "Confidential" by the Disclosing Party. Unless expressly permitted in writing, or as legally mandated, the said information shall not be divulged to any other entity. Confidential Information does not encompass information known to the public domain, independently created by the Receiving Party without benefiting from Confidential Information, or obtained legitimately from a third-party source.

**Version 5: Detailed Clause with Annotations**

The party designated as "Recipient" [hereinafter referred to as "Recipient"] shall exercise the highest degree of care to ensure that Confidential Information provided by the Disclosing Party [hereinafter referred to as "Discloser"] remains secret. Disclosure, unauthorized copying, or dissemination of such information is strictly prohibited, save for instances where legal compulsion dictates otherwise. This covenant, however, shall not apply to information: (i) that is a matter of public record without fault of the Recipient; (ii) that is independently realized by the Recipient with the absence of any use of the Discloser’s Confidential Information; or (iii) that is lawfully obtained from sources unrestricted by a confidentiality duty to the Discloser. ### Indemnity Clause Version 1
