Clause 1: Confidentiality Obligations

The Recipient agrees to preserve the confidentiality of all Proprietary Information received from the Disclosing Party, abstaining from any unauthorized disclosure or dissemination. The Recipient pledges not to utilize such information for any purposes other than those expressly authorized in this Agreement unless written consent is provided by the Disclosing Party. This obligation shall persist indefinitely or until such time as the Proprietary Information becomes public knowledge through no fault of the Recipient.

Clause 2: Protection of Confidential Information

The Receiving Party herein acknowledges the highly confidential nature of the Confidential Information it obtains during the course of this Agreement. It commits to exercising the utmost care in safeguarding this sensitive data, ensuring that such information is neither disclosed to third parties nor utilized beyond the stipulated scope of this contract, unless prior approval is secured from the Disclosing Party. This provision will remain binding until the aforementioned information enters the public domain, provided this occurrence is not attributable to a breach by the Receiving Party.

Clause 3: Secrecy Covenant

Both the Recipient and the Disclosing Party affirm their commitment to maintaining the confidentiality of all classified materials exchanged under this Agreement. The Recipient specifically agrees to restrain from divulging such materials to external parties and from applying them contrary to the purposes intended herein, without the express prior authorization from the Disclosing Party. The duty of confidentiality imposed by this clause survives the termination of this Agreement and continues as long as the information remains confidential.

Clause 4: Non-Disclosure Commitment

The party in receipt of confidential disclosures, henceforth referred to as the "Recipient," solemnly undertakes not to reveal, convey, or otherwise communicate any confidential information to unauthorized entities. Such proprietary information must be used solely for purposes approved in accordance with this Agreement. As a matter of duty, the Recipient's obligations regarding secrecy continue perpetually, or until the data in question becomes openly accessible to the public domain by lawful means not instigated by the Recipient.

Clause 5: Secret Information Handling

It is acknowledged and agreed that any Confidential Information shared during the term of this Agreement must be kept strictly confidential. The Receiving Party commits to protecting such information with reasonable, diligent measures, ensuring that it is not disseminated beyond permitted circles or exploited outside the boundaries of this Agreement unless explicit, written consent is furnished by the Disclosing Party. The secrecy and confidentiality obligation will endure indefinitely or until the information is release lawfully without the fault of the Receiving Party. **Clause 1: Unexpected Events Relief**

In the event that either party is hindered or delayed in the performance of any of their obligations under this Agreement due to any circumstance that is beyond their reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, civil disturbance, strikes or labor disputes, or governmental interventions, such party shall be excused from the performance of said obligations for the duration of such force majeure event. The affected party shall promptly notify the other party of the occurrence of the event, operations to mitigate its effects, and shall resume performance as soon as practicable. Obligations suspended by any such extraordinary event shall be extended for a period equal to the period of such suspension.

**Clause 2: Act of Nature and Unforeseeable Incident Provision**

Neither party shall be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this contract if such delay or failure is due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control including, but not limited to, natural catastrophes, unexpected regulatory changes, and public calamities. The burden of proving such an event lies with the claiming party, who must notify the other party within ten (10) business days of its occurrence. The parties shall endeavor to discuss in good faith a mutually satisfactory resolution to the exigencies arising from the force majeure.

**Clause 3: Fortuitous Events and Uncontrollable Situations Clause**

Should any obligation, duty, or responsibility cease to be executable by either party due to an event or series of events originating from an external source, such as pandemics, widespread infrastructure failures, or sanctions, and which are beyond the grasp of the partiesâ€™ anticipation or control, those respective responsibilities shall be temporarily waived during the span of the impediments. The affected party agrees to exercise reasonable diligence to remedy the situation and minimize its impacts and shall communicate progress updates to the unaffected party on a periodic basis. 

**Clause 4: Extrinsic Event Exoneration Clause**

Neither party shall be considered in breach of this Agreement or held liable for any delay in performance or failure to perform any obligations under this Agreement if such delay or failure results from any external, extraordinary event such as, but not limited to, military actions, governmental embargoes, extreme weather events, or unforeseen national policies. It is incumbent on the impeded party to give notice to the other party promptly upon the occurrence of such event and to use its best efforts to resume performance thereafter. Obligations thus hindered shall be deferred until the cessation of the relevant circumstances, provided, however, that if such delay persists beyond a stipulated period, either party may have the option to terminate the Agreement.
