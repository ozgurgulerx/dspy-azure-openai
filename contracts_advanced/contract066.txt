1. **Unforeseen Eventualities Clause**  
In the eventuality of circumstances beyond the reasonable foresight and control of either party, including but not limited to acts of nature such as earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes, or human-caused disruptions like strikes, lockouts, or governmental impositions, the affected party's responsibilities under this agreement shall be temporarily suspended. Such suspension of duties shall endure only for the duration necessary to mitigate the impact of said events.

At the discretion of either party, provisions may be reviewed or renegotiated in light of such extraordinary occurrences.  

2. **Circumstances Beyond Control Provision**  
Should unforeseen and unintended occurrences, which could be inclusive of natural phenomena such as tornadoes, tsunamis, or pandemics, or any other unavoidable external interferences, impede the capability of any party to uphold their contractual commitments, such parties shall be temporarily absolved from their responsibilities, until such obstacles no longer pose a hindrance.

Whereas unanticipated and overpowering factors, including nature-led catastrophes such as blizzards, droughts, or such-like, or events orchestrated by human design like acts of terrorism or widespread insurrections, render the fulfilment of contractual responsibilities impracticable, the obligations of the affected party shall be held in abeyance for a period reasonably necessitated by the duration and impact of the event. The affected party is obliged to inform the counterpart in a timely manner, indicating the scope and expected period of hindrance. Subsequently, both parties may, if mutually agreed upon, confer to make necessary adjustments to reflect the altered reality imposed by such extraordinary events. **Clause 1: Confidential Information Protection**
