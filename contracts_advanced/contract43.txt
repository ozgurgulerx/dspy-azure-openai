**Version 4: Creative Legalese with Optional Phrasing**

**Guardianship of Safety and Indemnity:**

Henceforth, and with enduring commitment, each party enshrines the obligation to safeguard, indemnify, and defend the counterpart from the onslaught of claims, actions, and proceedings, irrespective of frivolity or substance, alongside accompanying financial impositions, complete with all manner of fees and costs, including, if deemed necessary, those of legal counsel agreed upon by both parties, that would ensue from noncompliance, oversight, or any deviation from the duties articulated within this Agreement. This safeguard might be waived should the indemnified party, in an act not foreseen herein, contribute directly through negligence most egregious or conduct most intentional to the occurrence of such burdens.

These clauses offer varied structures and language to suit different contractual preferences and legal contexts. **Force Majeure Clause**

1. **Uncontrollable Events Exemption**  
Neither Party shall be held liable nor responsible for any delay or failure in performance of any part of this Agreement to the extent that such delay or failure is caused by events or circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the affected Party including, but not limited to, acts of God, governmental actions, war, fire, flood, inclement weather, strikes, or other labor disputes (collectively, "Force Majeure Events"). It is agreed that the Party experiencing such an impediment must notify the other Party in writing within a reasonable period of time, detailing the occurrence of the Force Majeure Event and its anticipated impact on contractual obligations.

2. **Acts of Providence Clause**  
In the circumstance that either Party to this Agreement is hindered, delayed, or prevented from performing any obligation hereunder by reason of unforeseen natural phenomena, government regulations, hostilities, natural calamities, labor unrest, or other events beyond the control of humans (collectively referred to as “Acts of Providence”), such Party shall not be deemed in breach of this Agreement. The affected Party shall, as soon as practicable, notify the counterpart in writing of the nature and anticipated timeline of the Force Majeure condition. Performance under this Agreement shall be deemed suspended while the Force Majeure condition persists.

3. **Clause of Extraordinary Circumstances**  
"Force Majeure" shall refer to extraordinary events or provisions beyond the reasonable foresight and control of either Party, such as acts of terror, natural disasters, pandemic outbreaks, embargoes, or any legislations that render performance impracticable or illegal. In the instance that a Force Majeure Event arises, the affected Party shall be excused from any delay in performance or failure thereof, on the condition that they use all reasonable diligence to alleviate its effects. Prompt written notice is to be provided to the other Party, specifying the event and estimating the duration of non-performance.

4. **Supreme Force Disclaimer**  
This Agreement acknowledges that the Parties shall be absolved from liability for non-performance, or delays therein, when caused directly or indirectly by supreme forces beyond control, including, without limitation, natural disasters, acts of war, civil commotion, and disruptions in supply chains. The affected Party is required to promptly inform the other Party of such events, with reasonable supporting details, and to take all appropriate and possible measures to minimize any resultant delay in performance.

5. **Beyond Control Situations Clause**  
The Parties hereto agree that they shall not be liable for any failure to fulfill obligations under this contract resulting from situations beyond their control and influence, including but not limited to earthquakes, hurricanes, war, insurrections, and other overwhelming situations ("Force Majeure"). The impacted Party must promptly provide a detailed account and anticipated resumption timeline in writing to the other Party if performance under this Agreement is foreseen to be affected.

Each distinct variation emphasizes the unpredictability and uncontrollability of force majeure events while advising prompt communication and due diligence between the affected and non-affected parties. **Arbitration Clause Version 1:**
