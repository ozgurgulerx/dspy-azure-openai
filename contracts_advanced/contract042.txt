**Option 1:**

The Party of the First Part hereby agrees to shield and safeguard the Party of the Second Part from any and all liabilities, damages, or unfavorable legal actions arising out of or in connection with third-party grievances, claims, or demands. This assurance includes, without limitation, indemnifying against lawsuits, financial losses, or any claims initiated by external entities. Moreover, the commitment herein entails holding the Party of the Second Part completely exonerated and free from any potential encumbrance or burden associated with such external claims, unless attributable to the negligence of the indemnified party.

This protective undertaking covers a broad spectrum of legal challenges, including, but not limited to, indemnification against judicial actions, monetary deficiencies, or external incursions. The First Entity’s obligation further extends to rendering the Second Entity immune from any burdens that might emerge from third-party disputes, barring any direct fault of the indemnified Entity.

**Option 3:**
