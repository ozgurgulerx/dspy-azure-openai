**Section X: Confidentiality Agreement** **X.1. Definition of Confidential Information** For the purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall mean any and all information, data, or material disclosed by one Party (the "Disclosing Party") to the other Party (the "Receiving Party") in connection with the performance of this Contract, whether orally, in writing, visually, or by any other means, which is designated by the Disclosing Party as confidential or proprietary, or which, given the nature of the information or the circumstances surrounding its disclosure, reasonably ought to be understood by the Receiving Party to be confidential. Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, business strategies, financial data, customer lists, research, products, services, designs, software, business plans, trade secrets, and any other information that derives independent economic value from not being generally known. **X.2. Obligations of Confidentiality** The Receiving Party hereby agrees:
(a) To maintain such Confidential Information in strict confidence and shall use at least the same degree of care as it uses to protect its own confidential and proprietary information of like kind (but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care);
(b) Not to disclose or otherwise make available any Confidential Information to any third party without prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, except as expressly permitted herein;
(c) To use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of fulfilling its obligations under this Contract and not for any other purpose or for its own or any third party's benefit. **X.3. Exceptions to Confidentiality** The obligations set forth herein shall not apply to any portion of the Confidential Information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate:
(a) Was publicly known at the time of disclosure or has become publicly known through no wrongful act of the Receiving Party;
(b) Was rightfully received from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure;
(c) Was independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to or reliance upon the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information;
(d) Was approved for release in writing by the Disclosing Party. **X.4. Compelled Disclosure** In the event that the Receiving Party is required by legal process, law, regulation, or government order to disclose any of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall, to the extent legally permissible, provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such request or requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy. In the absence of a protective order, the Receiving Party may disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which it is legally obligated to disclose and shall use reasonable efforts to have confidential treatment accorded to the disclosed information. **X.5. Duration of Confidentiality Obligations** The obligations of confidentiality and non-use set forth in this Section shall commence upon the Effective Date of this Contract and shall continue with respect to each disclosure of Confidential Information for a period of five (5) years following the date of termination or expiration of this Contract, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties. **X.6. Return or Destruction of Confidential Information** Upon termination or expiration of this Contract, or at any time upon written request by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party agrees to promptly return or destroy all materials embodying Confidential Information, including all copies, notes, summaries, or abstracts thereof. If requested by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall provide written certification to the Disclosing Party that such return or destruction has occurred. **X.7. Ownership and No License** All Confidential Information remains the sole property of the Disclosing Party. Nothing in this Contract shall be construed as granting or conferring any rights by license or otherwise, expressly or impliedly, under any patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights of the Disclosing Party. **X.8. Remedies** The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that any actual or threatened breach of this Section may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages alone will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief and any other equitable remedies in the event of any such breach or anticipated breach, without the necessity of posting a bond or other security, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity. **X.9. Survival** This Section shall survive the termination or expiration of this Contract for any reason. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Section shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Section or any other part of this Contract. **X.10.
