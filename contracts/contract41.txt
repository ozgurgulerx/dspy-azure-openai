**Data Protection Clause** **1. Introduction and Purpose** 1.1 This Data Protection Clause ("Clause") is hereby incorporated into and forms a part of this Agreement to ensure the protection, confidentiality, integrity, and lawful processing of all personal and sensitive data ("Data") collected, used, or stored in connection with the performance of this Agreement. **2. Definitions** 2.1 For the purposes of this Clause, "Data" shall include any data, whether true or false, about an individual who can be identified from that data, or from that data and other information to which the Data Controller has access.  2.2 "Data Controller" means the entity that determines the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Data. 2.3 "Data Processor" refers to the entity that processes Data on behalf of the Data Controller. 2.4 "Processing" means any operation or set of operations performed on Data, whether or not by automated means, including but not limited to collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction. **3. Compliance with Data Protection Laws** 3.1 Each Party agrees to comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws, regulations, and guidelines, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and any other jurisdiction-specific data protection legislation as amended from time to time. **4. Scope and Limitation** 4.1 The Data Controller shall determine the purposes for which and the manner in which Data is processed. 4.2 The Data Processor shall process Data solely on documented instructions from the Data Controller, including transfers of Data to a third country or an international organization, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which the Processor is subject. **5. Security Measures** 5.1 The Parties hereby agree to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including but not limited to: (a) The pseudonymization and encryption of Data where appropriate; (b) The ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services; (c) The ability to restore the availability and access to Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; (d) A process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing. **6.

Sub-Processing** 7.1 The Data Processor shall not engage another Data Processor without prior specific or general written authorization of the Data Controller. In the case of general written authorization, the Processor shall inform the Controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other Processors, thereby giving the Controller the opportunity to object to such changes. **8. Data Subject Rights** 8.1 The Parties shall cooperate as necessary to enable Data subjects to exercise their rights under applicable data protection laws with respect to accessing, correcting, erasing, or objecting to the processing of their Data. 8.2 The Data Processor shall, to the extent legally permitted, promptly notify the Data Controller if it receives a request from a Data subject to exercise such rights and ensure that it does not respond to that request except on documented instructions from the Controller or as required by applicable laws. **9. Data Retention and Erasure** 9.1 Data shall not be retained for longer than is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by applicable law. 9.2 Upon termination of this Agreement, or upon the Data Controller’s written request, the Data Processor shall, at the discretion of the Data Controller, delete or return all Data and copies thereof to the Controller, unless applicable law requires storage of the Data. **10. International Transfers** 10.1 Should the processing of Data require a transfer to countries outside the European Economic Area that do not ensure an adequate level of data protection, such transfer shall be subject to additional appropriate safeguards as required by applicable data protection laws. **11. Audits and Inspections** 11.1 The Data Processor agrees to make available to the Data Controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this Clause and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by the Controller or another auditor mandated by the Controller. **12.
