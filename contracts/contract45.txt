This encompasses, but is not limited to, trade secrets, business strategies, financial data, client lists, marketing plans, technical specifications, designs, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and all other proprietary business, product, or technological information that the Disclosing Party considers confidential. 1.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include information that:
(a) is or becomes publicly known or available without breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party;
(b) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation of confidentiality;
(c) was known to the Receiving Party, without restriction, prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party; or
(d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. **2. Obligations of Confidentiality** 2.1 The Receiving Party acknowledges the confidential and proprietary nature of the Confidential Information and agrees to hold and maintain the Confidential Information in strictest confidence. The Receiving Party agrees to perpetually protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized use, dissemination, or disclosure using the highest degree of care. 2.2 The Receiving Party shall limit access to the Confidential Information to its employees, agents, or third-party contractors who have a legitimate business need to know in furtherance of this Agreement and are bound by substantial confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than those contained herein. 2.3 The Receiving Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, disclose, publish, or otherwise reveal any part of the Confidential Information to any person, entity, or third party. **3. Permitted Disclosures** 3.1 In the event that the Receiving Party or any of its representatives are required by law, regulation, or court order to disclose any of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall promptly provide the Disclosing Party with written notice of any such requirement to disclose so that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy at the Disclosing Party’s expense. 3.2 If, failing the entry of a protective order or other remedy, the Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required to be disclosed. **4. Return or Destruction of Materials** 4.1 Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon the Disclosing Party’s request, the Receiving Party shall promptly return all materials, documents, databases, or other media related to or containing the Confidential Information, without retaining any copies thereof. 4.2 Alternatively, upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall destroy all such documents or materials and provide written certification of such destruction. **5.
