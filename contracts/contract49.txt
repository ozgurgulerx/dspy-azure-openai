**Section X: Force Majeure Clause** **Force Majeure Clause** 1. **Definition of Force Majeure**  
   For the purposes of this Agreement, “Force Majeure” shall mean any event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of the Parties, which was not foreseeable at the time of the execution of this Agreement, and which prevents, delays, or materially impairs the performance, in whole or in part, of any obligation under this Agreement. Such events may include, but are not limited to, acts of God, acts of civil or military authority, acts of war, acts of terrorism, riots, civil commotion, insurrection, sabotage, labor strikes (excluding those involving employees of the Party declaring Force Majeure), lockouts, epidemics, pandemics, natural disasters, fires, floods, explosions, and other similar events. 2. **Notice of Force Majeure**  
   In the event that a Party is unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement due to a Force Majeure event, such Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing. The notice shall include a detailed description of the Force Majeure event, an estimate of its expected duration, and the nature of the impact it is causing on the affected Party’s ability to perform its obligations. Such notice must be given no later than seven (7) business days after the occurrence of the Force Majeure event. 3. **Effect of Force Majeure**  
   Upon providing such notice as required herein, the affected Party shall be excused from the performance of those obligations directly impeded by the Force Majeure event, from the date of such notification. The affected Party shall resume the performance of its obligations promptly upon the cessation of the Force Majeure event and its effects. 4. **Mitigation**  
   The affected Party shall use reasonable diligence to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure event upon the performance of this Agreement and undertake reasonable commercial efforts to overcome the impediments resulting from such Force Majeure occurrence.  5. **Duration**  
   Should the Force Majeure event and its impacts continue for a period exceeding ninety (90) consecutive days, either Party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the other Party. Such termination shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement. In such event, neither Party shall have any liability to the other Party caused by such termination, except for obligations which accrued and were due prior to the onset of the Force Majeure event. 6. **Exclusions**  
   Force Majeure shall not include:  
   a. Financial distress nor the inability of either Party to make a profit or avoid a financial loss;  
   b. Changes in market prices or conditions;  
   c. A Party’s financial inability to perform its obligations hereunder. 7. **Non-Waiver of Rights**  
   The invocation of this Force Majeure clause shall not waive or suspend any rights of the non-affected Party to claim damages or enforce its rights under this Agreement, except for the delay or non-performance caused by the Force Majeure event. 8. **Resolution of Disputes**  
   Any disputes arising in connection with the application or interpretation of this Force Majeure clause shall be resolved through negotiation between the Parties. If the Parties cannot resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days, it shall be referred to arbitration as stipulated in Section Y of this Agreement. 9. **Communications**  
   All notices and communication required under this Force Majeure clause shall be made in accordance with the notice provisions set forth in Section Z of this Agreement. Notices must be delivered by confirmed email, registered mail, or courier service to the addresses provided herein. 10. **Continuing Obligations**  
    Except for the specific obligations excused due to a Force Majeure event, all other obligations under this Agreement shall continue with full force and effect. The Parties shall exert reasonable efforts to ensure continuity of those obligations unaffected by such Force Majeure event. 11. **Revisions and Amendments**  
    If a Force Majeure event necessitates amendments to this Agreement, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to amend the Agreement. Any such amendment shall be executed in writing and signed by both Parties, setting forth terms consistent with the changes necessitated by the Force Majeure event. 12. **Acknowledgment**
