**Section 11: Data Protection Clause** 11.1 **Definitions**  
For the purposes of this Clause, “Data Protection Legislation” refers to any applicable laws or regulations pertaining to the protection of personal data, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ("GDPR"), the Data Protection Act 2018, and any subsequent amendments or re-enactments thereof. “Personal Data” shall have the meaning attributed to it within the Data Protection Legislation and shall include any data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person as processed under this Agreement. 11.2 **Data Controller and Data Processor**  
The Parties acknowledge and agree that, with respect to the processing of Personal Data under this Agreement, either Party may act as a Data Controller or a Data Processor, depending on the context in which the Personal Data is processed. The role of each Party shall be determined in accordance with the principles set forth in the Data Protection Legislation. 11.3 **Obligations of the Data Processor**  
Should a Party function as a Data Processor, it shall:  
(a) process the Personal Data only on documented instructions from the Data Controller, including with regard to transfers of Personal Data to a third country or an international organisation, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which the Data Processor is subject;  
(b) ensure that persons authorised to process the Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;  
(c) implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate:  
   (i) the pseudonymisation and encryption of Personal Data;  
   (ii) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services;  
   (iii) the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;  
   (iv) a process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.  
(d) assist the Data Controller by appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of the Data Controller's obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's rights laid down in Chapter III of the GDPR;  
(e) at the choice of the Data Controller, delete or return all the Personal Data to the Data Controller after the end of the provision of services relating to processing, and delete existing copies unless Union or Member State law requires storage of the Personal Data;  
(f) make available to the Data Controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this Clause and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by the Data Controller or another auditor mandated by the Data Controller. 11.4 **Data Breach Notification**  
Each Party shall notify the other Party without undue delay upon becoming aware of a Personal Data Breach and shall provide information relating to the breach as the other Party may reasonably request. 11.5 **Sub-Processing**  
The Data Processor shall not engage another processor (a "Sub-Processor") without prior specific or general written authorisation of the Data Controller. In the case of general written authorisation, the Data Processor shall inform the Data Controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other processors, thereby giving the Data Controller the opportunity to object to such changes. 11.6 **International Transfers**  
Where applicable, any transfer of Personal Data to a third country or an international organisation by the Data Processor shall take place only on the basis of documented instructions from the Data Controller and in compliance with the Data Protection Legislation. 11.7 **Data Subject Rights**  
The Parties agree to uphold the rights of data subjects as provided under the Data Protection Legislation. Each Party shall assist the other in ensuring compliance with such rights, including but not limited to the rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing, data portability, object to processing, and rights related to automated decision-making. 11.8 **Indemnity**  
Each Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) shall indemnify the other Party (the “Indemnified Party”) and keep the Indemnified Party indemnified against all claims, liabilities, costs, expenses, damages, and losses, including any interest, penalties, and legal and other professional fees and expenses awarded against, suffered, or incurred by the Indemnified Party arising out of or in connection with any breach by the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Clause. 11.9 **Term and Termination**  
The obligations of the Parties set out in this Clause shall endure notwithstanding termination of this Agreement until such time as all Personal Data is returned or securely deleted in accordance with subsection 11.3(e) of this Clause. 11.10 **Governing Law**
