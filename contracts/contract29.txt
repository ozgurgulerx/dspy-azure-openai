**Confidentiality Agreement** **1. Purpose and Scope** This Confidentiality Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as of [Effective Date], by and between [Party A], a corporation organized and existing under the laws of [State/Country], with its principal place of business at [Address] ("Disclosing Party"), and [Party B], a corporation organized and existing under the laws of [State/Country], with its principal place of business at [Address] ("Receiving Party"). The purpose of this Agreement is to ensure the protection of Confidential Information (as defined herein) disclosed during the period of collaboration, potential business transactions, or any other business relationship between the parties. **2. Definition of Confidential Information** For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall mean all data and information, whether written, electronic, or oral, disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party that is designated as confidential or that should reasonably be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information may include, but is not limited to, trade secrets, business strategies, technical data, marketing plans, financial information, customer lists, software, prototypes, designs, drawings, specifications, and any and all proprietary data, protected patient information, and other non-public business information of the Disclosing Party. **3. Obligations of Receiving Party** 3.1. The Receiving Party agrees to hold all Confidential Information in strict confidence, using at least the same degree of care it employs to protect its own confidential and proprietary information, but no less than a reasonable standard of care. 3.2. The Receiving Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, disclose or permit the disclosure of any Confidential Information to third parties, except to those of its employees, agents, or advisors (collectively, "Representatives") who have a need to know the Confidential Information for the purpose of advancing the business relationship contemplated herein and who are bound by confidentiality obligations no less stringent than those contained in this Agreement. 3.3. The Receiving Party shall not reproduce Confidential Information in any form except as required to accomplish the intent of this Agreement. Any reproduction shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party and shall contain any and all confidential or proprietary notices or legends that appear on the original or any copies thereof. 3.4. The Receiving Party shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party of any unauthorized revelation, release, or use of Confidential Information and shall take all reasonable measures to prevent further unauthorized use or disclosure thereof. **4. Exclusions from Confidential Information** The obligations of the Receiving Party under this Agreement shall not apply to information that: 4.1. is or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; 4.2. was known to the Receiving Party prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, as evidenced by the Receiving Party's written records; 4.3. is disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third party who has a right to make such disclosure without any obligation to keep such information confidential; or 4.4. is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to or reliance upon the Confidential Information, as evidenced by the Receiving Party’s written records. **5. Compulsory Disclosure** In the event that the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives are requested or required by legal process, law, governmental decree, or regulation to disclose any of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of any such requirement before disclosure so that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy. If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the Receiving Party shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which, according to legal counsel, is legally required and shall use reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Confidential Information. **6. Term and Termination** The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue until the earlier of: (i) [Number] years from such date, or (ii) until terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice. Notwithstanding the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the obligations of the Receiving Party with respect to Confidential Information under this Agreement shall survive for a period of [Number] years following the date of such expiration or termination. **7. Return of Materials** Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, or upon the Disclosing Party’s written request, the Receiving Party shall promptly return or destroy all materials in any medium containing or reflecting any Confidential Information, and no retained copies shall be made of such material. **8. Remedies** The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that any breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party, for which monetary damages would be insufficient. Therefore, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. **9. Miscellaneous** 9.1. This Agreement and any actions related thereto will be governed by the laws of [State/Country] without regard to its conflict of laws principles. 9.2. Any amendments or modifications to this Agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties. 9.3.
