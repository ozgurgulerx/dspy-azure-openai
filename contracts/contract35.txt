**Confidentiality Agreement** **1. Definitions** 1.1 "Confidential Information" shall mean any and all information, whether written, oral, electronic, visual or in any other form whatsoever, disclosed by one party (hereafter referred to as the "Disclosing Party") to the other party (hereafter referred to as the "Receiving Party"), including, but not limited to, proprietary data, trade secrets, financial information, business strategies, marketing plans, customer lists, technical data, software, inventions, processes, designs, drawings, engineering, and any other non-public business information.  1.2 "Permitted Purpose" shall mean the use of Confidential Information solely for the purpose of executing, performing, and facilitating the transactions and obligations contemplated by this Agreement. **2. Obligations of Confidentiality** 2.1 The Receiving Party hereby agrees to maintain the strict confidentiality of the Confidential Information and shall treat it with the same degree of care as it would its own proprietary information of a similar nature, but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care. 2.2 The Receiving Party shall use the Confidential Information only for the Permitted Purpose and shall not disclose it to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, except as expressly permitted under this Agreement. 2.3 The Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information to its officers, employees, agents, or representatives ("Representatives") who have a clear need to know for the Permitted Purpose, provided that such Representatives are bound by confidentiality obligations substantially similar to those contained herein. **3. Exclusions from Confidential Information** 3.1 Confidential Information shall not include any information which: (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Representatives in violation of this Agreement; (b) is lawfully received by the Receiving Party from a third party without obligations of confidentiality, provided that the Receiving Party had no knowledge that the third party was under an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party; (c) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its receipt from the Disclosing Party, as evidenced by written documentation; or (d) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to or reliance upon the Confidential Information, as evidenced by written documentation. **4. Mandatory Disclosure** 4.1 In the event that the Receiving Party or its Representatives are required by law, regulation, or court order to disclose any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such requirement, to the extent legally permissible, so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. 4.2 If, in the absence of a protective order, the Receiving Party determines, upon the advice of counsel, that it is legally required to disclose Confidential Information, it may disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which it is legally required to disclose. **5. Return or Destruction of Materials** 5.1 Upon the termination of this Agreement or upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall promptly return or, at the Disclosing Party's option, destroy all materials embodying the Confidential Information, including any copies or extracts thereof, and certify in writing to the Disclosing Party that all such materials have been returned or destroyed. **6. No License** 6.1 Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights, by license or otherwise, to any patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, or other proprietary rights of the Disclosing Party with respect to the Confidential Information. **7. Remedies** 7.1 The Receiving Party acknowledges that any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party, for which monetary damages would be inadequate. Accordingly, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain any unauthorized use or disclosure, without the necessity of posting bond or proving actual damages. **8. Term** 8.1 The obligations of confidentiality set forth herein shall commence on the date of disclosure of the Confidential Information and shall continue for a period of five (5) years following the termination or expiration of this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties. **9.
