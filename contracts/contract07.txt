**Confidentiality Agreement Section** **1. Definitions** 1.1. "Confidential Information" shall mean any and all data, information, or material in any form, whether oral, written, graphic, magnetic, electronic, or otherwise, that is disclosed by one party (hereinafter referred to as the "Disclosing Party") to the other party (hereinafter referred to as the "Receiving Party"), directly or indirectly, that relates to the business operations, strategies, finances, intellectual property, technology, processes, products, services, suppliers, personnel, clients, or customers of the Disclosing Party, or any other information which a reasonable person would recognize as confidential or proprietary given the context of its disclosure. 1.2. "Proprietary Data" shall include, but not be limited to, trade secrets, inventions, ideas, processes, formulas, and know-how, whether patentable or not, that are disclosed to the Receiving Party for the purposes of this Agreement. **2. Obligations of Confidentiality** 2.1. The Receiving Party agrees to retain all Confidential Information in strict confidence and shall exercise the same degree of care to protect such information that it exercises to protect its own confidential and proprietary information, but in no event less than reasonable care. 2.2. The Receiving Party shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any third party without the express prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, and shall ensure that any permitted disclosure is limited to those employees, agents, or subcontractors who have a need to know such information for the purposes of this Agreement and are under obligations of confidentiality not less stringent than those contained herein. 2.3. The Receiving Party shall not use any Confidential Information for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party. **3. Exceptions** 3.1. The obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to any portion of Confidential Information that: (a) was known to the Receiving Party prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party without an obligation of confidentiality; (b) was or becomes part of the public domain through no fault or action of the Receiving Party; (c) is disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third party with the lawful right to make such disclosure without breach of this Agreement; or (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to or use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information. **4. Required Disclosure** 4.1. In the event that the Receiving Party or any of its representatives is requested or required by legal process to disclose any of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such request or requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement.  4.2. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party may disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which it is legally required to disclose. **5. Term and Return of Materials** 5.1. This Confidentiality Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue in perpetuity unless terminated in writing by mutual consent. 5.2.

Remedies** 6.1. The Receiving Party acknowledges that the Disclosing Party may suffer irreparable harm in the event of any breach of its obligations under this Agreement and that monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate for such a breach. Accordingly, the Receiving Party agrees that the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including the issuance of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction, in addition to any other rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity, in a court of competent jurisdiction. **7.
