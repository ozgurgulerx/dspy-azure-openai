**CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT** **1. Definition of Confidential Information** 1.1 For the purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall mean all non-public, proprietary, or sensitive information, in any form or medium, whether written, oral, visual, electronic, or otherwise, disclosed by or on behalf of one Party (the "Disclosing Party") to the other Party (the "Receiving Party") that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential, given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information includes, without limitation, trade secrets, business plans, strategies, forecasts, operations, marketing materials, customer lists, pricing structures, financial information, technical data, research, inventions, processes, designs, drawings, engineering, software and hardware configurations, and any other materials that are proprietary to the Disclosing Party. **2. Obligations of Confidentiality** 2.1 The Receiving Party shall exercise the same degree of care to protect the secrecy and confidentiality of the Confidential Information as it employs to safeguard its own confidential information of like nature, but in no event shall the Receiving Party use less than reasonable care. 2.2 The Receiving Party agrees to: (i) maintain the Confidential Information in strict confidence; (ii) not disclose, publish or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party; (iii) use the Confidential Information solely for the purposes contemplated under this Agreement and for no other purpose; and (iv) restrict access to Confidential Information to only those employees, agents, or representatives who have a need to know such information in connection with the performance of this Agreement and who have executed a confidentiality agreement with terms at least as restrictive as those contained herein. **3. Exceptions** 3.1 The obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to any information which: (i) was in the public domain at the time of disclosure or thereafter enters the public domain without any breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; (ii) was lawfully received by the Receiving Party from a third party without any restriction and without breach of a duty of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party; (iii) was already in the possession of the Receiving Party prior to receiving the same from the Disclosing Party, as evidenced by the Receiving Party's written records; or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party. **4. Legal Disclosure** 4.1 In the event the Receiving Party is required by law, regulation, or court order to disclose any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall (i) promptly notify the Disclosing Party of such requirement prior to disclosure; (ii) cooperate with the Disclosing Party in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy; and (iii) disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information legally required to be disclosed, provided that any Confidential Information so disclosed shall maintain its confidentiality protection for all purposes other than the specific legal requirement to disclose. **5. Return or Destruction of Confidential Information** 5.1 Upon termination of this Agreement, or upon the Disclosing Party’s written request, the Receiving Party shall, at the Disclosing Party's option, return or destroy all documents and other tangible materials representing the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information and any copies thereof. Upon request, the Receiving Party shall provide a written certification of compliance with this Section. **6. No License** 6.1 Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights, by license or otherwise, to either Party to any of the other Party’s Confidential Information, except as expressly set forth herein. All intellectual property rights related to the Confidential Information will remain the property of the Disclosing Party. **7. Remedies** 7.1 The Parties acknowledge that any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party could cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages may be difficult to ascertain or an inadequate remedy. Therefore, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, specific performance, or other equitable relief to enforce the terms of this Agreement, without the necessity of posting a bond or other security, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity. **8.
