The primary purpose of this Agreement is to ensure the protection of Confidential Information as defined herein, which may be disclosed during the course of activities under the Contract.  **Section 2: Definitions** For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them: a. "Confidential Information" shall mean all non-public, proprietary, or sensitive information, whether communicated orally, in writing, electronically, or by any other means, which is disclosed by one Party (the "Disclosing Party") to the other Party (the "Receiving Party"), including but not limited to business strategies, financial data, technical specifications, research and development, client lists, supplier information, business processes, and any other information that could reasonably be deemed proprietary or confidential by the Disclosing Party. b. "Permitted Recipient" shall mean any employee, consultant, advisor, or agent of the Receiving Party who needs access to the Confidential Information for the purposes of fulfilling the contractual obligations of the Receiving Party under the principal Contract and is bound by similar confidentiality obligations. **Section 3: Obligations of Confidentiality** 3.1 The Receiving Party agrees to handle the Confidential Information with the utmost care and diligence. The Receiving Party shall employ all reasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information, at least equivalent to the degree of care used to safeguard its own proprietary information of similar sensitivity. 3.2 The Receiving Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, disclose, disseminate, or make accessible the Confidential Information to any third party, except to Permitted Recipients who are under binding contractual obligations of confidentiality and only to the extent necessary for the contractual performance. 3.3 The Receiving Party shall not use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than as expressly authorized by this Agreement or the principal Contract. **Section 4: Exclusions from Confidential Information** The obligations in Section 3 shall not apply to any information that: a. Is or becomes part of the public domain without breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; b. Is rightfully received from a third party not subject to any confidentiality restrictions and having no obligations of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party; c.

Consequently, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctions and specific performance, in the event of any breach or threatened breach, in addition to any other rights or remedies available at law or in equity. 6.2 The Receiving Party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Disclosing Party from any losses, damages, claims, or expenses arising out of or in connection with the unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information by the Receiving Party or any Permitted Recipient. **Section 7: Return or Destruction of Confidential Information** Upon the termination of the principal Contract, or upon written request by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall promptly return or certify the destruction of all copies, whether in written, electronic, or other forms, of the Confidential Information, except to the extent that retention of such information is required by law or regulatory requirements. **Section 8: Miscellaneous Provisions** 8.1 **Governing Law**: This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the [State/Country], without regard to its conflict of laws principles. 8.2 **Severability**: Should any provision of this Agreement be held to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, such provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to render it valid and enforceable, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. 8.3 **Entire Agreement**: This Agreement, along with the principal Contract and any other referenced documents, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties regarding the subject matter and supersedes all prior understandings, agreements, or representations. 8.4 **Amendments**: No modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by duly authorized representatives of both Parties.
